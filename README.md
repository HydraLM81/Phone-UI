# Phone-UI
Created this as a semester project for my C++ class on Replit then converted it to Windows and fixed some bugs that I hope my teacher won't notice. (also unnecessarily large and unoptimized)

This is a basic command window application I created for my first semester project for my C++ class that includes some "apps" I created earlier in the year. 
The first app on there is a version of Wordle I created in which you can play as many times as you want and it has color. The second app is a list app specifically for shopping that keeps track of items and their subsequent asile. It can sort the items alphabetically (to the third letter) and by asile number. Also it isn't designed to hold more than about 20 items (don't remember the actual number) because at that point the screen will start to stretch, but there shouldn't be any bugs with that. The third app is a simple rock paper scissors against a randomized "ai" (it's a number generator) that took way more lines that it should have, but it works and looks... decent and keeps track of score. The fourth app is the settings app and it lets you choose the color of the text and border throughout the entire time the program is running.
I'm sure that if I were to put more effort into actually testing it, I'd find more bugs, but I already submitted it almost 2 weeks from the time I'm writing this README, so I don't really care. I just wanted to make it run on windows as a .exe, and I have.
